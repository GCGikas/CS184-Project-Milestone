            For the milestone checkpoint, I will talk about progress made on the chosen
            algorithm for my fluid simulation and will also talk about some changes that
            I have made to my goals.
        </p>

        <h2 align="padded">Progress Summary</h2>
        <p>
            For my implementation of a solution to this problem, I chose to utilize the
            algorithm presented in a research paper by Jos Stam at the University of
            Toronto. The reason that I decided on this specific algorithm was because
            it focuses on speed and believability over extreme accuracy. While the
            Navier-Stokes equations are the standard for fluid simulation, they are
            far too complex to run anywhere close to real-time. I have followed the
            algorithm in the paper to implement a grid like system that tracks densities
            of fluid at their respective locations. Using this system, density is exchanged
            between neighboring locations as a function of fluid moving through an environment
            to simulate actual flow. This process occurs through diffusion, which I also implemented
            to perform the moving of density between neighbors. I have begun work on changes in velocities
            in the flow, but have yet to finish the implementation. In addition, I have decided that I will
            be continuing to use Unity as a simple way of showing the flow visually. I can place objects into the environment
            that can represent the densities at each location, which can show how the fluid is moving.
            I have prior experience working in Unity, so this portion should take less time than implementing the rest
            of the algorithm.
        </p>

        <h2 align="padded">Preliminary Results</h2>
        <p>
            I do not have any visual results to present for the milestone so far. This
            is because I am still working on implementing the 2D version of the
            algorithm, and will attempt to extend it to 3D as described in the paper.
            My progress for the first week is admittedly a bit slow, but I intend to spend
            much time throughout this weekend and through the week to finish implementation
            and begin construction of interactive components of the simulation. If it is
            necessary for me to present images in the milestone, please let me know and I
            will try to insert images as soon as the full 2D implementation is complete.
        </p>

        <h2 align="padded">Change of Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Because of the feedback that I received on the project proposal, I had to consider
            the possibility that I would be unable to finish a 3D implementation in time. As a
            result, the algorithm presented by Jos Stam appealed the most. It is a relatively less complex
            algorithm when compared to the others I had researched, and according to the author
            of the research paper can be extended to 3D without too many modifications. This means
            that I would first be able to implement the 2D version before making the decision on 3D
            simulation. As a result, I will have a 2D algorithm to fall back on should my attempt
            to implement 3D fluid simulation end in failure for whatever reason. Regardless of whether or not my
            final implementation is in 2D or 3D, I intend to make a decision on which version to use well before
            the due date of the project, as I still need to create a way to show my algorithm in
            action. This will most likely be either a video involving fluid traveling through an
            environment or more preferably an actual method for user interaction with the fluid. This section of
            the project should be far less difficult, as I have used the Unity engine in the past and have
            experience in it.
